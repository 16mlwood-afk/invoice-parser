# Story 5.3: User Documentation

**Status:** Draft

**Epic:** Epic 5: Testing & Documentation

## User Story

As a user,
I want comprehensive documentation,
so that I can effectively install and use the invoice parser.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Installation instructions
2. Usage examples for all features
3. API documentation
4. Troubleshooting guide

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Previous epics established comprehensive parsing, CLI, and reporting capabilities with multi-language, multi-currency, and batch processing support. Stories 5.1 and 5.2 focused on testing infrastructure. This documentation story completes Epic 5 by ensuring users can effectively install, use, and troubleshoot the invoice parser across all supported workflows.

### Data Models
User documentation requires comprehensive coverage of all data structures and workflows:
- Installation procedures for different environments (local, global npm)
- Usage patterns for single file, batch processing, and programmatic API
- Error message catalog and troubleshooting procedures
- Configuration options and environment variables
- Output format specifications and examples

### API Specifications
Documentation must cover all public APIs and interfaces:
- CLI command structure and options
- Programmatic API methods and parameters
- Configuration and environment setup
- Error handling and response formats
- Integration patterns for different use cases

[Source: docs/architecture/backend-architecture.md#api-design]

### Component Specifications
Documentation components include:
- README.md with comprehensive setup and usage
- API reference documentation
- Troubleshooting guides with common issues
- Example code snippets and configuration files
- Installation verification procedures

### File Locations
Documentation files will be created and updated in the project root and docs directory:
- `README.md` - Primary user documentation
- `docs/api-reference.md` - API documentation (new file)
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Troubleshooting guide (new file)
- `examples/` directory with usage examples (new directory)
- Update existing documentation for consistency

### Testing Requirements
Documentation requires validation of all examples and procedures. Installation instructions must be tested on clean environments. Usage examples must execute successfully and produce expected outputs. Troubleshooting scenarios must be reproducible and solvable using the provided documentation.

### Technical Constraints
- Documentation must be accurate and up-to-date with current implementation
- Examples must work with real test data from `all_regions_test_data/`
- Documentation should follow clear structure and navigation
- Include both CLI and programmatic usage patterns
- Provide cross-platform installation instructions
- Ensure documentation is accessible to both technical and non-technical users
