# Story 1.1: Project Setup and Basic Structure

**Status:** Draft

**Epic:** Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

## User Story

As a developer,
I want a properly initialized Node.js project with basic structure,
so that I can begin implementing the core parsing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Node.js project initialized with package.json containing all required dependencies
2. Basic project directory structure established following the defined architecture
3. Git repository initialized with initial commit
4. Basic README with setup instructions documented
5. Package.json includes proper scripts for development workflow

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories - this is the foundation story for the project.

### Data Models
No specific data models required for project setup - this is infrastructure work.

### API Specifications
No API specifications required for project setup - this is CLI-only infrastructure.

### Component Specifications
No UI components required - this is CLI application setup.

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure from architecture:
- Root level: package.json, README.md, .gitignore
- Source code: index.js (main entry point)
- Tests: test.js, test-real-pdfs.js
- Documentation: docs/ directory structure

### Testing Requirements
Project setup does not require specific testing beyond ensuring the package can be installed and basic scripts run.

### Technical Constraints
- Node.js 18+ runtime requirement [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#runtime-requirements]
- npm for package management [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#package-management]
- Cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#platform-support]

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Task 1: Initialize Node.js Project
- Create package.json with proper metadata and dependencies
- Include required dependencies: commander (CLI), winston (logging), joi/zod (validation)
- Set up proper Node.js version requirement (>=18.0.0)
- Configure main entry point (index.js)

### Task 2: Establish Project Structure
- Create docs/ directory for documentation
- Create test/ directory for test files (if following standard convention)
- Set up .gitignore for Node.js project
- Create basic directory structure matching architecture specifications

### Task 3: Initialize Git Repository
- Run `git init` to initialize repository
- Create initial .gitignore with Node.js patterns
- Add initial commit with project structure
- Set up basic Git configuration

### Task 4: Create Basic Documentation
- Update README.md with project description and setup instructions
- Include installation steps and basic usage examples
- Document the project structure and file organization
- Add license file if required

### Task 5: Configure Development Scripts
- Add npm scripts for common development tasks (test, lint, start)
- Configure basic build process if needed
- Set up development workflow scripts

### Task 6: Verify Project Setup
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies install correctly
- Execute basic npm scripts to verify functionality
- Confirm Git repository is properly initialized
- Validate project structure matches architecture requirements

## File Change Summary

**New Files Created:**
- package.json (project configuration and dependencies)
- README.md (updated with setup instructions)
- .gitignore (Node.js project patterns)
- docs/README.md (documentation placeholder)

**Modified Files:**
- None (initial setup)

**Tests Added:**
- None (infrastructure setup - testing comes in later epics)

## Project Structure Notes

Project structure aligns with unified project structure defined in architecture:
- Root level configuration files properly placed
- Source code in root (index.js) as specified for CLI application
- Documentation in docs/ directory as required
- No conflicts with defined architecture patterns
