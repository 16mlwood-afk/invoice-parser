# Story 2.2: French Invoice Support

**Status:** Draft

**Epic:** Epic 2: Multi-Format Support

## User Story

As a user with French Amazon invoices,
I want the parser to handle French language and EUR currency,
so that I can process invoices from amazon.fr.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. French text patterns recognized
2. French date formats parsed correctly
3. French currency formatting handled
4. French item descriptions extracted accurately

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 2.1 successfully implemented German invoice support with enhanced multi-language capabilities. The system now handles German patterns (Bestelldatum, Zahlbetrag, EUR formatting) while maintaining English compatibility. This foundation provides the pattern for extending to French marketplace requirements.

### Data Models
French invoice data follows similar structure to German/English invoices but with French terminology and formatting:
- Date formats: "29 novembre 2025", "29/11/2025", "29.11.2025"
- Currency: EUR (€) with French decimal notation (1 588,22 €)
- Terminology: "Commande", "Facture", "TVA" instead of English/German equivalents

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required - this extends existing data extraction services to handle French language patterns. The core parseInvoice method will automatically detect and process French invoices.

### Component Specifications
Extend existing extraction methods in index.js to include comprehensive French pattern matching. Add French-specific regex patterns for:
- Order references (Numéro de commande, N° commande)
- Date formats (French date conventions and formats)
- Amount formatting (French number formatting with spaces)
- Item descriptions (French product terminology)

### File Locations
Core implementation remains in index.js with enhanced regex patterns. No additional files required - this is an extension of existing extraction logic.

### Testing Requirements
Test with French invoice samples from amazon.fr. Validate all French-specific patterns work correctly. Ensure French EUR formatting is preserved in output.

Test data should include French invoices showing "Commande", "Facture", "Montant total" patterns.

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing English and German patterns
- Add French patterns as additional regex options
- Preserve French number formatting (1 588,22 €) in output
- Ensure French date parsing handles various French date formats
- Performance impact should be minimal (additional regex patterns)
