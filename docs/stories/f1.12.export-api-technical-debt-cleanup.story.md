## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story F1.10 completed theme toggle fixes. The export API in routes/export.js has accumulated significant technical debt including critical bugs, monolithic functions, missing validation, and poor error handling that needs immediate attention for production stability.

### Data Models

**Export Request Schema:**
```typescript
interface ExportRequest {
  jobId: string;
  format: 'pdf' | 'csv';
  template?: 'standard' | 'detailed' | 'summary';
}

interface ExportLimits {
  maxRecords: number;
  pdfMaxInvoices: number;
  csvMaxRecords: number;
}
```

**PDF Generation Config:**
```typescript
interface PDFConfig {
  pageSize: [number, number];
  margins: {
    top: number;
    bottom: number;
    left: number;
    right: number;
  };
  colors: {
    primary: string;
    secondary: string;
    accent: string;
  };
  fonts: {
    header: string;
    body: string;
  };
}
```

### API Specifications

**Export Endpoint (Existing - To be Enhanced):**
```
GET /api/export/:jobId/:format/:template?
Response: File download (PDF/CSV) or JSON error
Headers:
  - Content-Type: application/pdf or text/csv
  - Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="..."
  - Content-Length: <calculated correctly>
  - X-Export-Limit-Warning: <warning if approaching limits>
```

**Error Response Format:**
```typescript
interface ExportError {
  error: string;
  message: string;
  errorCode: string;
  details?: {
    maxAllowed?: number;
    currentCount?: number;
  };
}
```

### Component Specifications

**No new UI components required for this technical debt cleanup**

### File Locations

**Core Export Files:**
```
src/api/export.js                              # Main export logic (to be refactored)
utils/pdf-report-generator.js                  # New: PDF generation module
utils/result-transformer.js                    # New: Result transformation utility
config/export.config.js                        # New: Export configuration
