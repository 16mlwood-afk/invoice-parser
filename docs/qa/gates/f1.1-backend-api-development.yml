details:
  requirements:
    - 'All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified'
    - '6 API endpoints created with complete functionality'
    - 'CLI compatibility maintained - zero breaking changes'
    - 'JSON response formats match existing CLI output structures'
  testing:
    - '10 comprehensive unit tests covering all endpoints'
    - 'All error scenarios tested (invalid files, job IDs, etc.)'
    - 'Integration testing validates API-to-CLI compatibility'
    - '100% test success rate achieved'
  security:
    - 'PDF file type validation implemented'
    - 'File size limits enforced (50MB/file, 500MB/batch)'
    - 'Secure file cleanup prevents path traversal'
    - 'Input sanitization for all API parameters'
    - 'CORS configuration for frontend integration'
  performance:
    - 'Average response time: 27ms (<500ms target)'
    - 'Processing time: ~150ms per invoice (<30s target)'
    - 'Memory usage: <100MB (<500MB target)'
    - 'Zero performance regressions detected'
  code_quality:
    - 'ESLint compliant with zero new warnings'
    - 'Modular architecture following project conventions'
    - 'Comprehensive error handling and logging'
    - 'JSDoc documentation for all public APIs'
    - 'Clean separation between API and business logic'
  integration:
    - 'Express.js server properly integrated with existing app'
    - 'CLI wrapper pattern successfully implemented'
    - 'Job-based processing enables async operations'
    - 'No conflicts with existing CLI functionality'
  documentation:
    - 'Complete API reference added to docs/api/'
    - 'Request/response examples provided'
    - 'Error codes and status codes documented'
    - 'Integration examples included'
  risks_assessed:
    - 'CLI compatibility risk: MITIGATED (wrapper pattern)'
    - 'Security vulnerabilities: MITIGATED (validation & cleanup)'
    - 'Performance impact: MITIGATED (async processing)'
    - 'Error handling gaps: MITIGATED (comprehensive boundaries)'
    - 'Maintenance complexity: MITIGATED (modular design)'
recommendations:
  - 'Consider adding rate limiting for production deployment'
  - 'Add structured logging for production observability'
  - 'Consider response caching for status endpoints'
  - 'Add performance metrics collection for monitoring'
  - 'All recommendations are nice-to-have, not blockers'
