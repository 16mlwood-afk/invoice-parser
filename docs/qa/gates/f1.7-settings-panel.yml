  # Integration Verification
  - id: "iv-1"
    description: "Configuration options match existing CLI parameters"
    status: "completed"
    notes: "Settings options align with CLI parser regions (us/eu/de/fr/uk/ca/jp/au), currencies, languages, and output formats. Validation rules match CLI constraints."

  - id: "iv-2"
    description: "Settings persistence doesn't interfere with CLI configuration"
    status: "completed"
    notes: "Frontend settings are stored in browser localStorage and don't interfere with CLI configuration files. Server sync ensures consistency."

  - id: "iv-3"
    description: "Validation rules align with existing parser constraints"
    status: "completed"
    notes: "Client-side validation mirrors CLI parser constraints including region availability, currency support, and confidence thresholds."

  # Code Quality
  - id: "cq-typescript"
    description: "TypeScript strict mode compliance"
    status: "completed"

  - id: "cq-eslint"
    description: "ESLint compliance with existing configuration"
    status: "completed"
    notes: "Code follows established ESLint rules with proper imports, consistent formatting, and no linting errors in implemented files"

  - id: "cq-structure"
    description: "Proper component structure and separation of concerns"
    status: "completed"
    notes: "Clean separation between store (state management), API (server communication), components (UI), and validation logic. Each component has single responsibility."

  - id: "cq-error-handling"
    description: "Comprehensive error handling and user feedback"
    status: "completed"
    notes: "Implemented error boundaries, validation feedback, loading states, and graceful degradation for API failures"

  # Testing Coverage
  - id: "test-unit"
    description: "Unit tests for all settings components"
    status: "completed"
    notes: "Created unit tests for ParserSettingsTab, ValidationErrors, ValidationSummary components. Tests cover rendering, user interactions, and state updates."

  - id: "test-integration"
    description: "Integration tests for settings API and persistence"
    status: "completed"

  - id: "test-accessibility"
    description: "Accessibility testing for settings interface"
    status: "completed"
    notes: "Tests verify ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and focus management. Components include proper accessibility attributes."

  - id: "test-performance"
    description: "Performance testing for settings operations"
    status: "minor"
    notes: "Basic performance validation completed. Performance benchmarks (1s load, 500ms save, 100ms validation) need runtime verification in production environment."

  # Security Validation
