# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Automate the tedious process of manual Amazon invoice data entry
- Provide accurate, structured JSON output for expense tracking and tax preparation
- Support multi-language and multi-currency Amazon invoice formats
- Enable batch processing of multiple invoices for efficiency
- Achieve >95% data extraction accuracy from Amazon invoice PDFs

## Background Context
The Amazon Invoice Parser addresses a critical pain point for consumers and small businesses who regularly purchase from Amazon and need to track expenses for tax purposes, budgeting, or reimbursement. Current methods involve manual transcription of invoice data, which is time-consuming and error-prone. This tool will extract structured data from Amazon invoice PDFs, supporting multiple languages and currencies, and provide both programmatic API access and command-line batch processing capabilities.

The project builds on existing invoice parsing research and aims to become the go-to solution for Amazon invoice data extraction, serving both individual users managing personal expenses and small businesses handling procurement records.
