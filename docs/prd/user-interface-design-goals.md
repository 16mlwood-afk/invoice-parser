# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The Amazon Invoice Parser is primarily a command-line utility designed for developers, accountants, and power users who need to process invoice data programmatically. The interface prioritizes simplicity, reliability, and integration capabilities over visual design.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- Command-line first: Simple, predictable commands for file processing
- Batch processing: Directory-based operations for efficiency
- Structured output: Consistent JSON format for programmatic consumption
- Error resilience: Clear feedback and graceful failure handling

## Core Screens and Views
- Command-line help and usage information
- Processing status with progress indicators
- Error reporting with actionable guidance
- Summary reports with spending analytics

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
While primarily a command-line tool, any future web interfaces will comply with WCAG AA standards.

## Branding
Open-source utility with clean, professional command-line interface. No specific branding requirements beyond clear, helpful documentation.

## Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform
- macOS, Windows, and Linux operating systems
- Node.js runtime environment
- Command-line interface compatible with standard terminals
